    A simple FastAPI application demonstrating RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) using OpenFGA.
    
    This demo showcases:
    - Organizations with admin/member roles
    - Resources owned by organizations
    - Permission inheritance from organization roles to resource permissions
    
    ## RBAC Model
    - **admin**: Can manage organization members and delete resources
    - **member**: Can view organization members and resources, create new resources
    - **Resources**: Inherit permissions from their owning organization
    
    All authorization is handled through OpenFGA using a simple, coarse-grained access control model.
